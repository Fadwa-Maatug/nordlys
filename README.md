# Nordlys

Nordlys is a toolkit for entity-oriented and semantic search.
It is a  step towards reproducible and extensible semantic search research, and is aimed to facilitate research in this area.

## What is it great about Nordlys?

- It supports 4 tasks related to entity-oriented search: 
	- Entity Linking in Queries **(EL)**
	- Entity Retrieval **(ER)**
	- Target Type Identification **(TTI)**
- It implements various baseline methods for each of these tasks.
- It provides an entity catalog **(EC)** service, used for representing DBpedia entities, their mappings to Freebase, and some basic statistics.
- It can used as a black box through a [RESTful API](http://api.nordlys.cc/).
- It can be deployed on a local server and used  through **command line**.
- It can be reached by a [GUI interface](http://gui.nordlys.cc/) and be used to perform user studies on result presentation
- It is based on the [3-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture) and is a highly modular, easy to understand code.
- It is an open source project and is meant to be a continuous effort.
