Nordlys is a toolkit for entity-oriented and semantic search.
It is a step towards reproducible and extensible semantic search research, and is aimed to facilitate research in this area.


## Nordlys is great because ...

- It supports three core entity-oriented search tasks:
	- Entity Retrieval
	- Entity Linking in Queries
	- Target Type Identification
- It implements various methods for each of these tasks (with more methods on their way).
- It provides an entity catalog service (based on the DBpedia knowledge base).
- It can used as a black box through a [RESTful API](http://api.nordlys.cc/).
- It can be deployed on a local server and used as a Python package or as a command line tool.
- It can be reached by a [GUI interface](http://gui.nordlys.cc/) and be used to perform user studies on result presentation
- It is based on a 3-tier architecture, is highly modular, and [well documented](http://nordlys.readthedocs.io/) code.
- It is an open source project and is meant to be a continuous effort.


## Disclaimer

Nordlys is not (yet) a mature production-level system, but a research prototype (as can be seen from the current version number, which is v0.2).

We welcome contributions on all levels (pull requests, suggestions for improvements, feature requests, etc.).
