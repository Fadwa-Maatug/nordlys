Nordlys is a toolkit for entity-oriented and semantic search, built by the IAI group of the University of Stavanger.

## What is nordlys?

  * It is an **open source Python library** that can be integrated into larger applications or can be used for research and experimentation.
  * It provides a **RESTful API** and **command line tools**, through which it can be used as a service, much like a black box.
  * The functionality is also available through a [graphical web user interface](http://gui.nordlys.cc).
